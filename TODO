* A bigger example.

The TestHSM example is too small, although it does show all the features of
cthsm.  So make a better, bigger example.


* Profiling.

When the bigger example does exist, profile it.  Find out if any bits of
CTHSM::CTHsm<C,E> are using up too much time.


* More tests.

Some ideas for more tests:

** Transition to a top state.

** Transition from a state to itself.

** Transition from the top state to somewhere else.

** Transition from the top state to itself.


* Transition actions

HSMs are meant to be able to associate actions with transitions, so that
when a particular transition occurs, a particular action happens.  The
sequence is meant to be

  exit action(s) - transaction action - entry action(s)

where the exit action(s) are for the state(s) being exited, and the entry
action(s) are for the state(s) being entered.

cthsm does not do this.  Fix.
