* A bigger example.

The TestHSM example is too small, although it does show all the features of
cthsm.  So make a better, bigger example.


* Profiling.

When the bigger example does exist, profile it.  Find out if any bits of
CTHSM::CTHsm<C,E> are using up too much time.


* More tests.

Some ideas for more tests:

** Transition to a top state.

** Transition from a state to itself.

** Transition from the top state to somewhere else.

** Transition from the top state to itself.
