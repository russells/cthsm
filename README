HSM in a C++ template.

The template header is fairly well commented, and testhsm.cc and testhsm.hh
contain an example class that responds to some events and prints out the
events it receives and the transitions it takes in response.

Inspiration is from the QP state machine framework, which is at
http://state-machine.com/.  The C++ QP implementation uses pointers to
static member functions with an explicit object pointer and type casting.
I thought that the system could be done in a more type safe manner with
templates.

This system, unlike QP, is unlikely to be useful in embedded systems.
